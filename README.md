# README #

ElectroSmart is an academic research project started in 2015 by 
[Arnaud Legout](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Arnaud.Legout/) at Inria, Sophia Antipolis, France.

The academic Web page of the project is [here](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Arnaud.Legout/Projects/electrosmart.html).

Late 2022, I did not have the resources to maintain ElectroSmart anymore. This is why I decided to
open source the code in October 2022 under a BSD 3-Clause License.

ElectroSmart latest developments and tests were performed against Android 12. It is, however, still 
compatible with Android 13. You can access the latest compiled APK [1.28R118](https://github.com/arnaudlegout/electrosmart/compiled_APK/app-release_1.28R118.apk). You can check the integrity of the file using sha256sum. The sha256sum must be `379cd889d78839e5d468c104f62d96003f75b211914a64688f6f1c5793e8edd6`.
