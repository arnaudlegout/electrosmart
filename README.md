# README #

ElectroSmart is an academic research project started in 2014 by Arnaud Legout at Inria,
Sophia Antipolis, France.

The academic Web page of the project is [here](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Arnaud.Legout/Projects/electrosmart.html)
The public Web page of the project (quite old and not up to date) is [here](https://electrosmart.app/)

Late 2022, I did not have the resources to maintain ElectroSmart anymore. This is why I decided to
open source the code in October 2022 under a BSD 3-Clause License.

ElectroSmart latest developments and tests were performed against Android 12. It is, however, still 
compatible with Android 13.
